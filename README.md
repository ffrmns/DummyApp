Inner Exception 1:
DependencyResolutionException: Circular component dependency detected: λ:MassTransit.IBusControl -> MassTransitVisitorPattern.MessageProcessor -> λ:MassTransit.IBusControl.

## Some confusion
Let's break down the program into its components and introduce some confusion:

    Autofac:
        Autofac is used for dependency injection, which means it helps manage the dependencies of various components in the program.
        However, in this program, the builder is registering IBusControl and IBus as single instances, but they are not actually being used as dependencies elsewhere in the code.

    MassTransit:
        MassTransit is a messaging library that simplifies communication between applications by using message queues.
        In this program, we're setting up an in-memory message queue using MassTransit, but the actual message processing logic (MessageProcessor) is fairly trivial and doesn't demonstrate the full power of MassTransit.

    Visitor Pattern:
        The Visitor pattern is used for handling different types of messages in a flexible and extensible way.
        However, in this program, the visitor pattern is somewhat overkill for handling just one type of message (SampleMessage). It adds unnecessary complexity.

    SemaphoreSlim:
        SemaphoreSlim is used for managing concurrency, allowing a specified number of threads to access a resource concurrently.
        However, in this program, the semaphore is being used in a somewhat arbitrary way. It's limiting concurrency to 5 when sending messages, but there's no clear reason why 5 is chosen or how it affects the overall behavior.

    Message Processing:
        The MessageProcessor class simulates processing a message by waiting for 1 second before publishing the message.
        However, in a real-world scenario, message processing logic would likely be more complex and involve interacting with external systems or performing meaningful computations.

Overall, while the program demonstrates the use of Autofac, MassTransit, the Visitor pattern, and SemaphoreSlim, it could be confusing due to the mismatch between the complexity of these concepts and the simplicity of the example code provided.
